This is a small project, completed on Week 2 of Code:You's web development pathway. 
As we were learning about forms, I decided to create a form trying to use all of the different input types available. 
I was inspired by Web Dev Simplified's simple Javascript to post the data to a results page. 
My main focus while working on this project was getting comfortable with different semantic HTML tags used for forms (like fieldset and legend)
and to add my own style using CSS, making sure it was responsive at smaller screen sizes.
